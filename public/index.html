            <li>Lions are the only cats that live in groups.</li>
            <br>
            <li>A group, or pride, can be up to 30 lions, depending on how much food and water is available.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Female lions are the main hunters. While they’re out looking for food, the males guard the pride’s territory and their young.</li>
            <br>
            <li>A lion’s roar can be heard up to eight kilometres away.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Lions scent mark their territory, using their wee, to create a border.</li>

         <h2>COVID-19</h2>
         <h5>Mar 11, 2021</h5>
         <p>Following the latest government guidelines our Zoo will remain closed. The government has now announced that the zoo will not be able to open any earlier than 12 April. 
            We are hopeful that we’ll be able to reopen the outdoor areas of the zoo on or around this date and we will keep adding updates as we have them.
            Whilst we had hoped we would be able to reopen earlier it’s great that we can now plan to get the zoo back open and welcome you back when it’s safe to do so.
         </p>
